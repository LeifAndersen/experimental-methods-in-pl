to re-run the timing results and then run plot.rkt in DrRacket to view
the results.

Content:

  trace/: contains the source for Pedro's algorithm that has been
          instrumented to dump out a trace of the operations on the
          datastructure

  pff.rkt: a script that accepts the name of a tracefile and an
           integer on the command-line. It runs three versions of the
           binomial-heap operations on the trace, contract-less, the
           optimized lazy contracts, and the flat contracts.

  log/: the results of earlier runs from the pff.rkt script

  *.trace.gz: the trace files generated by running the mkdata script

  mkdata: a script that builds the *.trace.gz files. It builds the
          programs in the trace/ directory and then runs the program.
