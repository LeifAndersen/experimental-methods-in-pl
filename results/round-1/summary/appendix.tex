\begin{description}
\item[Source:] Project Euler
\item[Overview:] Sum all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000
\item[Details:] Our algorithm uses the \mono{racket/stream}~library.
  First we create streams of all multiples of 3 and of all multiples of 5, then we lazily merge these streams into a one stream without duplicates.
  From this third stream, we take and sum elements until the next integer in the stream is greater than or equal to 1000.
  Flat contracts surround two functions: the \mono{main} function which computes our answer and the merging function, which is contracted to accept two streams of positive integers and return a third.
  We define a stream of positive integers as either an empty stream or a stream with a positive integer as its first element (we do not check or apply contracts to the tail of the stream).
