\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Our goal this semester was to assess the performance overhead of contracts in Racket, in particular, their effect on the JIT.
Here we present our findings an a suite of ten small programs.
These results are preliminary, but indicate that contracts do hinder the JIT's ability to optimize.
However this hindrance is overshadowed by the overhead of contracts alone.

\sect{experiment} of this document describes our experiments and conclusions.
\sect{discussion} recalls challenges we faced and lists our future plans.
The appendix gives a more detailed overview of our experimental programs and includes the raw data from which we built our figures.
