\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Our goal this semester was to assess the performance overhead of contracts; in particular, their effect on the JIT.
Here we present our findings an a suite of 8 small programs.
These results are preliminary, but indicate that contracts do hinder the JIT's ability to optimize.
However this hinderance is overshadowed by the overhead of contracts alone.

\sect{experiment} of this document describes our experiments and conclusions.
\sect{discussion} recalls challenges we faced and lists our future plans.
The appendix gives a more detailed overview of our experimental programs and includes the raw data tables from which we constructed our figures.
